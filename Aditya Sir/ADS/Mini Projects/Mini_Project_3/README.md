### :rocket: Mini-Project 3 based on DataStructurs of Java (Circular Doubly LinkedList).

## :dart: **Objective**
This project is to implement a music playlist manager using a Circular Doubly Linked List (CDLL) in Java. This playlist allows users to add, remove, and navigate through songs efficiently while maintaining a circular structure for continuous playback.

## :sparkles: **Key Features**

:white_check_mark: **Add & Remove Songs**
- Users can dynamically add new songs to the playlist.
- Songs can be removed by their title, ensuring flexible playlist management.

:white_check_mark: **Circular Playback**
- The playlist is implemented using a circular doubly linked list, allowing users to move to the next or previous song seamlessly.
- The last song connects back to the first, ensuring an infinite loop of music playback.

:white_check_mark: **Play Next & Previous Songs**
- Users can navigate forward (playNext()) or backward (playPrevious()) through the playlist.
- This mimics a real-world music player with continuous song transitions.

:white_check_mark: **Display Current Song & Entire Playlist**
- Users can check the currently playing song.
- A complete playlist display option allows users to view all songs in the queue.
