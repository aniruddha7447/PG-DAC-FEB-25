# :telephone: Contact Management System :ledger:
## :keyboard: This is a Console Based Application to manage Contact Numbers. :computer_mouse:

### :rocket: Mini-Project 1 based on DataStructurs of Java (Singly  LinkedList).

## :dart: **Objective**
This project aims to create a console-based contact management system using a singly linked list in Java. It demonstrates fundamental data structure operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal while efficiently managing contact details.


## :sparkles: **Key Features**

:white_check_mark: **Singly Linked List Implementation** 
- The contact list is managed using a singly linked list, where each node contains a contactâ€™s name, phone number, and a reference to the next node.

:white_check_mark: **CRUD Operations** 
- The program supports adding contacts at the end, removing contacts by name, searching for a contact, and displaying all contacts.

:white_check_mark: **Efficient Traversal & Updates** 
- Contacts are searched and removed by traversing the linked list, ensuring dynamic memory allocation without fixed size constraints.

:white_check_mark: **Console-Based Interaction** 
- The main method demonstrates adding, searching, displaying, and removing contacts, providing a simple text-based interface.
